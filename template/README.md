## Development

Everything is run via npm.

* `npm install` - Install all packages, build JS, SASS, lint, test
* `npm run `


# TODO

* make sure server starts and can serve the index.html
* Exercise all libraries to ensure it's all hooked up - e.g. ensure Jasmine mocks and all are working, plus font-awesome, mongodb, nock, etc
